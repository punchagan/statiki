=======

Statiki is a stylish interface to static site generation.

It provides a simple interface to build, deploy and manage static
sites using Nikola. (Or Pelican, Jekyll, OctoPress or any of the
[hundreds of static site generators](http://staticsitegenerators.net/)
It leverages free services like GitHub and Travis-CI to host static
sites for users.


## How-to start using statiki ##

1. Create an account on GitHub, if you don't have one.
2. Login/sign up on the home page.
3. Sign-up to travis-ci using your GitHub credentials (can this be
   automated out?)
4. Choose one of the following urls to create your site::

    `http://<username>.github.io` OR `http://<username>.github.io/<reponame>`

5. Click create.

    Uses Nikola by default to create your site.

    Or click on the advanced button to choose the static site
    generator to use, and may be change the configuration, as
    required.

6. Get redirected to the newly created page.

    This may take a while to be created.

7. All future edits can be made using GitHub's UI, or using something like
   prose.io.
